# GTA Connected Admin Script

This is a complete rewrite of the [Vortex v-admin script](https://github.com/VortrexFTW/v-essentials/tree/master/v-admin) for GTA Connected (GTA IV), designed for public use with enhanced features and a streamlined codebase. Certain features from my private version, such as making other players dance or killing them, have been stripped to focus on core administrative functionality. This script provides robust server management tools for administrators and moderators, including player management, bans, and chat enhancements.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Manage players with commands to kick, ban, tempban, unban, and toggle trainers or weapons.
- **Admin Roles**: Supports admin and moderator roles with configurable permission levels.
- **Ban System**: Permanent and temporary bans with reasons and expiration times, stored in `players.json`.
- **Chat Enhancements**: Emote support in chat messages (e.g., `:)` becomes üòä) for both client and server.
- **Script Blocking**: Block specific game scripts on GTA Connected to prevent unwanted behavior.
- **Admin Logging**: Logs all admin actions to `log.json` for accountability.
- **Configuration**: Customizable settings via `config.json`, including command levels and blocked scripts.
